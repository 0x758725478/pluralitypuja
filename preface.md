# Preface: Seeing Plural

> “In order to carry out a positive action we must develop here a positive vision… It is under the greatest adversity that there exists the greatest potential for doing good, both for oneself and others.” — Dalai Lama XIV

Anxiety over technology and geopolitics is pervasive today, with a fundamental conflict underway between great powers over technical supremacy.  More deeply, the path technological and democratic systems have taken have put them at loggerheads in an ensuing battle, claiming victims on both sides.


The dominant innnovations in technology in recent decades have been artificial intelligence and blockchains, which respectively have empowered centralized top-down control and turbo-charged atomized polarization and hyper-financialized capitalism.  Both outcomes are corrosive to the values of democratic pluralism.  It is little surprise then, that technology is widely seen as one of the greatest threats to democracy and as a powerful tool for both authoritarian adversaries and those who would subvert democracies from within, seeking to accelerate internal collapse.


At the same time, democracy was once a radical experiment to scale the governance of a city-state to many millions of citizens spread across continents.  Today it has become a synonym in much of the world for the increasingly desperate effort to preserve rigid, polarized, sclerotic, and increasingly illegitimate governments. We should not be shocked, therefore, by the disdain of so many technologists who view democratic participation as an impediment to progress.


In this book we hope to show that this tragic conflict is avoidable, and that properly conceived technology and democracy are powerful complements and natural allies. Arguments in this direction will naturally evoke eye-rolling from many quarters; a gulf of grievance and distrust between the two sides of this divide has developed over the last decade and will not easily be laid to rest.  Only by fully acknowledging and embracing the legitimate concerns and critiques of both sides of this conflict shall we have a chance of seeing its root cause and transcending it.  Thus, we begin by drawing out these grievances with a generous spirit, charitably accepting critiques even when they are imperfectly supported by the available evidence.  Trying to reconcile these maximal framings offers an opportunity to demonstrate the ambition of democratic technology.
