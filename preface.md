# Preface: Seeing Plural

> “In order to carry out a positive action we must develop here a positive vision… It is under the greatest adversity that there exists the greatest potential for doing good, both for oneself and others.” — Dalai Lama XIV

The advent of the internet made the world bigger and smaller. In one way, it expanded space, illuminating uncharted paths in digital dimensions beyond the physical limits of geography, threaded by time. With new bridges built on 0s and 1s, knowledge and new relationships blossomed across languages and cultures. New networks emerged, crossing villages and nation-states, reminiscent of the meticulous artistry of Athena's tapestry. But what seemed like a relentless march of progress towards the “end of history,”  propelled by the currents of digital technology and a surging wave of globalization, carried with it also new divisions: social status and widening inequality, making the world seem smaller. Colossal tech industries scaled off profitable collision courses and began to collapse burgeoning plurality into isolated islands of polarity. 

Today, democracy finds itself at a low tide. Authoritarian regimes, commanding nearly half of the global GDP, cast a disquieting shadow as singular, final solutions. Only a modest one billion people find solace under the umbrella of democratic systems, while 2.2 billion dwell under authoritarian rule.

Yet every culture tells its own tale, akin to a river winding through geography and history. We see the river of democracy as a conduit of hope, supporting rich, diverse ecosystems resilient to collapse. In the transformative era of the 1960s, democracy bore witness to technology that nursed the seeds of transculturalism on fecund riverbanks. As democracy's waters wane today, we must replenish it with the rain of open-source technology pulled from clouds of collective intelligence. Just as the most bio-diverse ecosystems from the Amazon to Borneo replenish our atmosphere with oxygen, similarly a digital fabric of trust and intelligence weaved across many can replenish rivers of democracy with fresh water, breathing life into lands hardened by authoritarianism and at risk of monocultural collapse into singularity.

In Mandarin, 數位 embodies both concepts of “plural” and "digital.” The idea of Plurality captures the symbiotic relationship between democracy and collaborative technology. The challenge of digitally transforming democracy might seem daunting, but it is not insurmountable. We acknowledge the interdependent relationship between rivers and the ecosystems they nourish—the artificial chasm between the physical and digital—and seek to fuse democracy with technology to make both greater than either alone.

This book reveals potent insights into digital democracy from across the globe. Our goal is to magnify the strength and virtue of cognitive diversity, mirroring the solidarity among the authors and contributors of this work. Taiwan's democratic innovations fortified by the commitment to digital rights resonate with this spirit: public collaboration, future-oriented consciousness, and bottom-up collective intelligence eschewing top-down dictates in favor of a participatory and fecund cyberspace unbounded by plurality.

In 2022, Taiwan proudly stood with over 60 nations in endorsing "The Declaration of the Future of the Internet," anchored by shared democratic ideals. A year later, in 2023, Denmark launched the "Digital Democracy Initiative" with the EU. As we navigate the rivers of democracy towards a plural future– bridging societal divides with civil society and an ethos of inclusive co-creation — our collective journey this time tells not a story of colonialism, domination, and collapse but a saga of cooperation, collaboration, and growth. The harmony extolled by ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras, the rule-altering power in J.R.R. Tolkien's Ainulindalë — these are just a few stories and principles of plurality, of which many more are to come.

Life, a ripple of atoms, is a lucky coincidence possible from infinite diversity in infinite combinations of cosmic stardust. Within the atomic microcosm, a 'string' vibrates, much like a symphony, reverberating through epochs of cultural fusion. Those of us resonating with Plurality can foster collaborative diversity through interoperable co-existence. This book is an invitation to counter totalitarianism, avert extinction, and free the future — together.
